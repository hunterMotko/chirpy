## Motivation

Building a robust API often involves handling boilerplate like routing, middleware, and database interactions efficiently. This project leverages the strengths of Node.js and Express to provide a clear, maintainable, and performant backend.

### Goal

The primary goal of this API is to offer a well-structured and documented set of endpoints for [mention key domain, e.g., "user authentication and content management"]. In particular, we focus on:

  * **Clean API Design:** Intuitive and consistent endpoint structure.
  * **Robust Error Handling:** Centralized error management for predictable responses.
  * **Database Integration:** Seamless interaction with PostgreSQL using Drizzle ORM.
  * **Scalability:** Designed with middleware and modular handlers for future growth.
  * **Observability:** Built-in logging and metrics for monitoring API health.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

To get this API up and running on your local machine, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

  * **Node.js**: `v18.x` or a newer LTS version.
  * **npm** (Node Package Manager) or **Yarn**.
  * **PostgreSQL**: A running PostgreSQL database server.

### Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [your-repository-url]
    cd [your-repository-name]
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```
3.  **Configure environment variables:**
    Create a file named **`.env`** in the root directory of your project. This file will hold your database connection string and the port for the API.
    ```env
    DB_URL=postgresql://your_user:your_password@localhost:5432/your_database_name
    API_PORT=3000
    ```
    *Replace `your_user`, `your_password`, `localhost:5432`, and `your_database_name` with your actual PostgreSQL credentials.*
4.  **Run database migrations:**
    This command will set up your database schema using Drizzle ORM.
    ```bash
    # Replace with your actual migration script, e.g.:
    npm run migrate
    ```
5.  **Start the server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    # or
    node index.js # or whatever your main entry file is named
    ```
    Your API will now be listening for requests at `http://localhost:3000` (or the port you configured).

      * **Success Response:**
        ```json
        {
          "status": "ok"
        }
        ```

### User Creation

  * **`POST /api/users`**
      * **Description:** Creates a new user account in the system.
      * **Request Body Example:**
        ```json
        {
          "username": "new_user",
          "email": "user@example.com",
          "password": "strong_password_123"
        }
        ```
      * **Response:**
        ```json
        {
          "id": "generated_user_id",
          "username": "new_user",
          "email": "user@example.com"
        }
        ```

### Chirp Creation

  * **`POST /api/chirps`**
      * **Description:** Publishes a new "chirp" (or post) by a user.
      * **Request Body Example:**
        ```json
        {
          "content": "This is my first chirp using the API!",
          "authorId": "user_id_of_the_author"
        }
        ```
      * **Response:**
        ```json
        {
          "id": "generated_chirp_id",
          "content": "This is my first chirp using the API!",
          "authorId": "user_id_of_the_author",
          "createdAt": "2025-06-04T16:00:00Z"
        }
        ```

## Other Usage Examples

See the [src/handlers](https://www.google.com/search?q=src/handlers) directory for the implementation details of each endpoint and how they interact with your application logic. This will give you a deeper understanding of the API's capabilities.

## API Endpoints (Comprehensive List)

This section provides a detailed list of all available API endpoints, their HTTP methods, and their purposes.

  * **`GET /api/healthz`**: Check API health.
  * **`POST /api/users`**: Create a new user.
  * **`PUT /api/users`**: Update an existing user.
  * **`POST /api/refresh`**: Refresh an access token.
  * **`POST /api/revoke`**: Revoke a refresh token.
  * **`POST /api/login`**: Authenticate a user and get tokens.
  * **`GET /api/chirps`**: Retrieve all chirps.
  * **`GET /api/chirps/:id`**: Retrieve a chirp by ID.
  * **`DELETE /api/chirps/:id`**: Delete a chirp by ID.
  * **`POST /api/chirps`**: Create a new chirp.
  * **`POST /api/polka/webhooks`**: Handle incoming webhooks (e.g., from Polka).
  * **`GET /admin/metrics`**: Access application metrics (admin-only).
  * **`POST /admin/reset`**: Reset application data (admin-only).

-----

## Options and Configuration

Your API's operational parameters are managed through a `config` object, typically loaded from environment variables. Key configuration points include:

  * **`config.db.url`**: Your PostgreSQL connection string.
  * **`config.db.migrationConfig`**: Configuration for database migrations.
  * **`config.api.port`**: The port on which the Express server will listen.

It's crucial to set these variables in your **`.env`** file or your deployment environment.

-----

## Middleware Explained

This API employs several middleware functions to streamline request processing:

  * **`middlewareLogResponse`**: Logs details of each incoming request and the corresponding outgoing response, aiding in debugging and monitoring.
  * **`middlewareMetricsInc`**: Increments internal metrics for each request, contributing to application observability.
  * **`errorMiddleWare`**: A centralized error handler that gracefully catches and formats any errors occurring during request processing, providing consistent and informative error responses.

-----

## Error Handling

Errors across the API are caught and processed by a dedicated **`errorMiddleWare`**. This ensures that clients receive well-structured error messages instead of raw server stack traces, improving the predictability and security of your API.

-----

## Database Migrations

This project utilizes **Drizzle ORM** with **Postgres.js** to manage database interactions and schema evolution. Migrations are automatically run at application startup via `migrate(drizzle(migrationClient), config.db.migrationConfig)`. This ensures your database schema is always up-to-date with your application's requirements.

-----

## Stability

The API is currently in active development. While we strive for stability, minor breaking changes may occur before a `v1.0.0` release. We recommend pinning to specific versions in production environments.

-----

## Integration Testing

Integration https://www.google.com/search?q=tests for this API can be run by setting the `ENABLE_DOCKER_INTEGRATION_TESTS=TRUE` environment variable when executing your https://www.google.com/search?q=tests (e.g., `npm test` or `yarn test`). These https://www.google.com/search?q=tests spin up a local PostgreSQL container using Docker and perform real API interactions to ensure functionality.

See the [test](https://www.google.com/search?q=test) directory (or wherever your integration https://www.google.com/search?q=tests are located) for more details.
